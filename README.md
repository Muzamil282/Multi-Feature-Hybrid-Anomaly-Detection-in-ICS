# Multi-Feature-Hybrid-Anomaly-Detection-in-ICS
This code is part of our research work. We made some changes from the original code.
This project implements a hybrid model combining machine learning, deep learning, and statistical techniques to detect anomalies in Industrial Control Systems (ICS). The model is designed to improve detection accuracy by leveraging multiple feature sets and algorithms.
